System overview
==================
The Virtual Cash Register System was written to provide a simple alternative to a paper driven procedure.  Searching the internet for inexpensive cash registers that could be easily moved, netted no results. Any software found was tied to a particular hardware device or some other accounting software.

Both accounting and marketing requirements were addressed. Accounting wants control and financial information, they do not need information about products sold whereas the marketing people need that information.

 Therefore, the following criteria was used to develop the Virtual Cash Register.

- Simplicity
- Minimum Security
- Portability

The system was developed with the idea that other organizations might want to use some components of the system. We submitted this system to Github and PHP,both open source enablers,so that others can use and improve the system.

This system is designed to capture transactions as they occur by the operator of the Virtual Cash Register which not only provides the accounting control but also provides marketing information. However, the Proxy Entry function allows some authorized person to enter only the accounting information from the paper shift reports provided by operators who either lack the hardware, and/or skill to use the Virtual Cash Register, at a later time.
