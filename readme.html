<h1>System overview</h1>

<p>The Virtual Cash Register System was written to provide a simple alternative to a paper driven procedure. Searching the internet for inexpensive cash registers that could be easily moved, netted no results. Any software found was tied to a particular hardware device or some other accounting software. Therefore, the following criteria was used to develop the Virtual Cash Register.</p>

<ul>
<li>Simplicity</li>
<li>Minimum Security</li>
<li>Portability</li>
</ul>

<p>The system was developed with the idea that other organizations might want to use some components of the system. We will be submitting this system to Github and PHP,both open source enablers,so that others can use and improve the system.</p>
